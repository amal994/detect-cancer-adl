# Using Deep Learning for Detecting Cancer In Pathology Images
In this project I implemented and trained two deep learning models to be used for the prediction of cancer in pathology images. 

This project follows the method of this [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.02442)

### This repository contains the following: 
- A PDF that describes the approach and evaluation. 
#### Code Folder
- Two jupyter notebooks one for each model. 

#### Models Folder
- The two trained models. 

This project is my final project for the Applied Deep Learning course at Columbia University, Spring 2019
